# Deep Thoughts

A tribute in Alexa skill form to Jack Handy and Deep Thoughts. 

I was able to find a text based list of most of Jack's Deep Thoughts online. It isnt hard to find. If you place the plaintext file here as `thoughts.txt`, this should run well for you. There isn't much to it. I also have my appId in `secret.js`. 

I am running it as a Lambda based development only Alexa skill right now and it is working alright.
